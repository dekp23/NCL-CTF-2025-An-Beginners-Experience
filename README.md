# NCL-CTF-2025-
An overview of my first Capture the Flag competetion

This was my first time competeing in a CTF Competetion.  As of 2025, I have recently got into cybersecurity, so while I have a bit more experience in computer science, I am very new to cybersecurity. 
I competed in both the Individual Game and the Team Game of the National Cyber League (NCL), and it was an absolute blast. I’d highly recommend it to anyone curious about cybersecurity—it’s hands-on, intense, and incredibly rewarding.


Throughout this entire experience, I learned an immense amount of knowledge about a wide range of topics and used a wide variety of tools and concepts including but not limited to:
- Network Scanning & Structure ([Nmap]([url](https://nmap.org/download)), port scanning) – My strongest category.
- Traffic Analysis ([Wireshark]([url](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html))) – Learned how to dissect packets and spot anomalies.
- Forensics (File carving, [Binwalk]([url](https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk))) – My toughest area, but I learned a lot.
- Log Analysis – Practiced parsing logs and identifying patterns.
- OSINT (Open Source Intelligence, metadata) – Used creative search techniques and metadata sleuthing.
- Password Cracking ([John the Ripper]([url](https://www.openwall.com/john/)), [Hashcat]([url](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/))) – Cracked hashes using wordlists and brute force.
- Cryptography ([CyberChef]([url](https://cyberchef.org/)), [dCode]([url](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier))) – Explored encoding, decoding, and cipher identification.
- Web App Exploitation (SQL injections, browser dev tools) – Practiced basic injection techniques and site analysis.



Some advice to someone who wants to compete:
1. Set up your own Kali Linux virtual machine -  it takes a long time but it will make your life a whole lot easier.  It has every possible tool you can think of.
2. Set up a DVWA or Damn Vulnerable Web Application -  a useful sandbox website that is made to be "hacked" into.  Helps you learn about many different kinds of attacks such as SQL and Command injections.
3. Ask questions -  whether it be to people in a club, discord server, or other professionals in the field.  From experience, they are always glad to help out.
4. Have fun and embrace mistakes -  I didn't do as I good as wanted to, but for my first time, I am happy with the score I acheived.  Even if you think that you're gonna do bad, try it anyway.  Your mistakes will only able to be learned from.

   So with that, I am looking forward to not only compete again, but to begin my journey into the wonderful field of cybersecurity as a whole!
